This is an interactive workbook for learning Python programming. It is designed to be:

1. Easy to set up. I've included minimal external libraries on purpose. 
2. Self-paced. The chapters are sequential.
3. Friendly to ALL learning styles: auditory, visual, both, trying things out, breaking stuff...
4. Free. Forever and ever, amen. 

How to set up:

1. Clone this repo.
1. Install Python 3+. Most computers come with this these days.
1. Install pip. 
1. Install jupyter with `pip install jupyter`.
1. Navigate to the repo.
1. Run `jupyter lab`. 

That's gonna open a browser tab that shows you all the folders on the left. You can navigate into the folders and open any of the .ipynb files. If you're new to all this, start at chapter 1. Each notebook links to videos explaining everything in them.
